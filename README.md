# siri-spotify-dictation
Spotify Voice Shortcut This macOS Shortcut + Python script lets you say “Hey Siri, Music by Voice” and dictate any song you want. It will search Spotify, open the track instantly, and works even on free Spotify accounts — no auto-play needed.  Built with love, Spotipy, and frustration toward Apple Music defaults 😅
